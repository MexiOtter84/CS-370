### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Within this project I helped develop a pirate simulater using reinforcement learning and neural networks. The goal of the game was to demonstrate teh agent's ability to learn and make decisions in a simulated envrionment.

The project started with a basic codebase that had a basic setup for the pirate agent and it implemented reinforcement of learning algorithims. There were also neural networks available as well utilization.

I implemented a design and training of a neural network model tailored to meet the requirements of the pirate challenge. There were also scripts created for data visualization to show impact.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design algorithims and systems to develop solutions to complex problems. Typically, computer scientists utilize the latest in technology to meet expectations of problems to provide those solutions.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist by first defining the problem and requirements of the overall project, break down the overall problem into sections that seem more manageable and innovate.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethically, I am responsible for making sure that the solutions that I develop and create meet all expectations and follow all requirements and are ethically sourced.
